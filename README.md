# 🚩 Challenge 4: Minimum Viable Exchange

This challenge will help you build/understand a simple decentralized exchange, with one token-pair (ERC20 BALLOONS ($BAL) and ETH). This repo is an updated version of the original tutorial and challenge repos before it. Please read the intro for a background on what we are building first!

🌟 The final deliverable is an app that {challengeDeliverable}.
Deploy your contracts to a testnet then build and upload your app to a public web server. Submit the url on [SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com)!

There is also a 🎥 [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP5w6Ger1EQ&t=364s&ab_channel=SimplyExplained) that may help you understand the concepts covered within this challenge too:

## Checkpoint 0: 📦 Install 📚

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (v18 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Then download the challenge to your computer and install dependencies by running:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges.git challenge-4-dex
cd challenge-4-dex
git checkout challenge-4-dex
yarn install
```

> in the same terminal, start your local network (a blockchain emulator in your computer):

```sh
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract (locally):

```sh
cd challenge-4-dex
yarn deploy
```

> in a third terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```sh
cd challenge-4-dex
yarn start
```

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

## ⛳️ Checkpoint 1: 🔭 The Structure 📺
Navigate to the Debug Contracts tab and you should see two smart contracts displayed called DEX and Balloons.

👩‍💻 Rerun yarn deploy whenever you want to deploy new contracts to the frontend (run yarn deploy --reset for a completely fresh deploy if you have made no contract changes).

Balloons.sol is just an example ERC20 contract that mints 1000 $BAL to whatever address deploys it. DEX.sol is what we will build in this challenge and you can see it starts with a SafeMath library to help us prevent overflows and underflows and also tracks a token (ERC20 interface) that we set in the constructor (on deploy).

Below is what your front-end will look like with no implementation code within your smart contracts yet. The buttons will likely break because there are no functions tied to them yet!

⭐️ Also note that there is no curve until you uncomment the specific lines of code at the end of `hardhat/deploy/00_deploy_your_contract.ts`.

### ⛳️ **Checkpoint 2: Reserves** ⚖️ 

We want to create an automatic market where our contract will hold reserves of both ETH and 🎈 Balloons. These reserves will provide liquidity that allows anyone to swap between the assets.

Add a couple new variables to `DEX.sol` for `totalLiquidity` and `liquidity`:

<details markdown='1'><summary>👩🏽‍🏫 Solution Code</summary>

```
uint256 public totalLiquidity;
mapping (address => uint256) public liquidity;
```

</details>

These variables track the total liquidity, but also by individual addresses too.
Now, let's create an `init()` function in `DEX.sol` that is payable and then we can define an amount of tokens that it will transfer to itself.

<details markdown='1'><summary> 👨🏻‍🏫 Solution Code</summary>

```
    function init(uint256 tokens) public payable returns (uint256) {
        require(totalLiquidity == 0, "DEX: init - already has liquidity");
        totalLiquidity = address(this).balance;
        liquidity[msg.sender] = totalLiquidity;
        require(token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokens), "DEX: init - transfer did not transact");
        return totalLiquidity;
    }
```

</details>

Calling `init()` will load our contract up with both ETH and 🎈 Balloons.

We can see that the DEX starts empty. We want to be able to call `init()` to start it off with liquidity, but we don’t have any funds or tokens yet. Add some ETH to your local account using the faucet and then find the `00_deploy_your_contract.ts` file. Find and uncomment the line below and add your front-end address:

```
  // // paste in your front-end address here to get 10 balloons on deploy:
  // await balloons.transfer(
  //   "0xe64bAAA0F6012A0F320a262cFe39289bA6cBd0f2",
  //   "" + 10 * 10 ** 18
  // );
```

Run `yarn deploy`. The front end should show you that you have balloon tokens. We can’t just call `init()` yet because the DEX contract isn’t allowed to transfer tokens from our account. We need to `approve()` the DEX contract with the Balloons UI.

🤓 Copy and paste the DEX address and then set the amount to 5000000000000000000 (5 _ 10¹⁸). You can confirm this worked using the `allowance()` function. Now we are ready to call `init()` on the DEX. We will tell it to take (5 _ 10¹⁸) of our tokens and we will also send 0.01 ETH with the transaction. You can see the DEX contract's value update and you can check the DEX token balance using the balanceOf function on the Balloons UI.

This works pretty well, but it will be a lot easier if we just call the `init()` function as we deploy the contract. In the `00_deploy_your_contract.ts` script try uncommenting the init section so our DEX will start with 5 ETH and 5 Balloons of liquidity:

```
  // // uncomment to init DEX on deploy:
  // console.log(
  //   "Approving DEX (" + dex.address + ") to take Balloons from main account..."
  // );
  // // If you are going to the testnet make sure your deployer account has enough ETH
  // await balloons.approve(dex.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("100"));
  // console.log("INIT exchange...");
  // await dex.init(ethers.utils.parseEther("5"), {
  //   value: ethers.utils.parseEther("5"),
  //   gasLimit: 200000,
  // });
```

Now when we `yarn deploy --reset` then our contract should be initialized as soon as it deploys and we should have equal reserves of ETH and tokens.

### 🥅 Goals / Checks

- [ ] 🎈 Under the debug tab, does your DEX show 5 ETH and 5 Balloons of liquidity?
- [ ] ❗ If you are planning to submit the challenge make sure to implement the `getLiqudity` getter function.

### ⛳️ **Checkpoint 3: Price** 🤑

This section is directly from the [original tutorial](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/%EF%B8%8F-minimum-viable-exchange-d84f30bd0c90) "Price" section. It outlines the general details of the DEX's pricing model.

If you need some more clarity on how the price in a pool is calculated, [this video](https://youtu.be/IL7cRj5vzEU) by Smart Contract Programmer has a more in-depth explination.

Now that our contract holds reserves of both ETH and tokens, we want to use a simple formula to determine the exchange rate between the two.
Let’s start with the formula `x * y = k` where `x` and `y` are the reserves:

```
(amount of ETH in DEX ) * ( amount of tokens in DEX ) = k
```

The `k` is called an invariant because it doesn’t change during trades. (The `k` only changes as liquidity is added.) If we plot this formula, we’ll get a curve that looks something like:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12072395/205343533-7e3a2cfe-8329-42af-a35d-6352a12bf61e.png)

> 💡 We are just swapping one asset for another, the “price” is basically how much of the resulting output asset you will get if you put in a certain amount of the input asset.

🤔 OH! A market based on a curve like this will always have liquidity, but as the ratio becomes more and more unbalanced, you will get less and less of the less-liquid asset from the same trade amount. Again, if the smart contract has too much ETH and not enough $BAL tokens, the price to swap $BAL tokens to ETH should be more desirable.

When we call `init()` we passed in ETH and $BAL tokens at a ratio of 1:1. As the reserves of one asset changes, the other asset must also change inversely in order to maintain the constant product formula (invariant k).

Now, try to edit your DEX.sol smart contract and bring in a price function!

<details markdown='1'><summary>👩🏽‍🏫 Solution Code</summary>

```

    function price(
        uint256 xInput,
        uint256 xReserves,
        uint256 yReserves
    ) public view returns (uint256 yOutput) {
        uint256 xInputWithFee = xInput * 997;
        uint256 numerator = xInputWithFee * yReserves;
        uint256 denominator = (xReserves * 1000) + xInputWithFee;
        return (numerator / denominator);
    }

```

</details>

We use the ratio of the input vs output reserve to calculate the price to swap either asset for the other. Let’s deploy this and poke around:

```
yarn run deploy
```

Let’s say we have 1 million ETH and 1 million tokens, if we put this into our price formula and ask it the price of 1000 ETH it will be an almost 1:1 ratio:

![image](https://github.com/mertcanciy/se-2-challenges/assets/59885513/77bac7a8-36c6-4d89-b60c-b0a0e14f706f)


If we put in 1000 ETH we will receive 996 tokens. If we’re paying a 0.3% fee it should be 997 if everything was perfect. BUT, there is a tiny bit of slippage as our contract moves away from the original ratio. Let’s dig in more to really understand what is going on here.
Let’s say there is 5 million ETH and only 1 million tokens. Then, we want to put 1000 tokens in. That means we should receive about 5000 ETH:

![image](https://github.com/mertcanciy/se-2-challenges/assets/59885513/a4f3754c-4362-45c4-90c6-2baccfe8a03e)


Finally, let’s say the ratio is the same but we want to swap 100,000 tokens instead of just 1000. We’ll notice that the amount of slippage is much bigger. Instead of 498,000 back we will only get 453,305 because we are making such a big dent in the reserves.

❗️ The contract automatically adjusts the price as the ratio of reserves shifts away from the equilibrium. It’s called an 🤖 _Automated Market Maker (AMM)._

### 🥅 Goals / Checks

- [ ] 🤔 Do you understand how the x\*y=k price curve actually works? Write down a clear explanation for yourself and derive the formula for price. You might have to shake off some old algebra skills!
- [ ] 💃 You should be able to go through the price section of this tutorial with the sample numbers and generate the same outputChange variable.

> 💡 _Hints:_ See this [link](https://hackernoon.com/formulas-of-uniswap-a-deep-dive), solve for the change in the Output Reserve. See the section in that link up to the uniswap v3 title.

> 💡💡 _More Hints:_ Also, don't forget to think about how to implement the trading fee. Solidity doesn't allow for decimals, so one way that contracts are written to implement percentage is using whole uints (997 and 1000) as numerator and denominator factors, respectively.
