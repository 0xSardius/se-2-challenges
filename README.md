# 🚩 Challenge 4: Minimum Viable Exchange

This challenge will help you build/understand a simple decentralized exchange, with one token-pair (ERC20 BALLOONS ($BAL) and ETH). This repo is an updated version of the original tutorial and challenge repos before it. Please read the intro for a background on what we are building first!

🌟 The final deliverable is an app that {challengeDeliverable}.
Deploy your contracts to a testnet then build and upload your app to a public web server. Submit the url on [SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com)!
